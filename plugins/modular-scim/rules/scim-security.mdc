scim-security:

- Authenticate all SCIM requests with proper bearer tokens
- Validate SCIM requests against schema
- Implement proper pagination for large result sets
- Filter sensitive attributes before returning users
- Log SCIM operations for audit purposes
- Implement proper bulk operation limits
- Validate group memberships before provisioning

Data handling:
- Mask or redact sensitive attributes in logs
- Implement proper permission checks for SCIM endpoints
- Validate user/group updates before applying
- Handle deprovisioning safely (soft delete preferred)
