web-auth-security:

- Use secure, HTTP-only cookies for session tokens
- Implement CSRF protection for state-changing operations
- Set proper security headers (X-Frame-Options, CSP, etc.)
- Rate-limit authentication endpoints
- Log authentication failures (without exposing passwords)
- Implement proper password hashing (bcrypt, argon2)
- Validate all inputs to prevent injection attacks

Session management:
- Set appropriate cookie expiration times
- Implement proper logout/session invalidation
- Use signed JWT tokens with proper expiration
- Store session data securely (server-side when possible)
